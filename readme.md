Bot can be added to your server with https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1015173351095935026&permissions=339008&scope=bot

It gives points based on teams or individual users - possible to view leaderboard for user and teams separately.

Bot currently needs a connection to a database (MySql used for development).

Please note you will need an .env file with the database connection to run the code, and a bot secret to connect it.
